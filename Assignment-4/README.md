For question 1, I have made a Library class that stores name, isbn and barcode of books.
sort class is used to sort the books by name, isbn or barcode using comparator.
Main class is used to create a library and add books to it.
Then the books are sorted and printed with appropriate rack position.

For question 2, I have made a abstract class to implement various functions called in grayscale and RGB class.
The grayscale class handles gray scale image and RGB class handles RGB image.
The main class is used to take the input and call the appropriate functions.
static function Negatives is used to print Negative matrices.
