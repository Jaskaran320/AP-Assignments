In this assignment, I have made a main class, a matrix class to store matrices,
a reader class to take input, an interface to implement the tasks and 15 classes
to represent the different types of matrices.
In the main class, I have implemented the methods to take corresponding input.
An arraylist of class Matrix is created and the matrices are added to the arraylist.
For every instance of Matrix class, I have implemented a method to check all possible types
and store them into an array.
The interface matrixfunctions has implemented the methods to find determinant, inverse, transpose,
mean and sum of matrix and its transpose.
The 15 classes corresponding to the different types of matrices implement these methods efficiently.
The class defaultMatrices stores a default matrix of each type which is used to implement the methods.
